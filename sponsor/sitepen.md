> Since the turn of the century we've been helping others create structurally sound, well architected Web applications. We were pioneers on the 'Ajax frontier' where we lived off the land and hand crafted the Dojo Toolkit to tame the wilderness (Firefox and IE5.5). With this groundwork in place, our small band of engineers turned our encampment into a bustling village of Open Source Web development that has been tirelessly forging new tools such as Intern, dstore, dgrid and the next major version of Dojo. Our passion for helping others continues as we teach explorers and new settlers the ways of the land through our hands-on workshops and development services.
