> Hudl is a software company that makes sports video analysis tools for coaches and athletes. Teams upload their game film to our site, study it, and "break it down" by adding text notes, ink telestrations, and tagged metadata.
> 
> Coaches then share the edited segments of video with groups of players on their team. Athletes can consume the annotated video on their iOS and Android devices throughout the week in preparation for their next game. If an athlete notices a great play, he or she can highlight it to appear on a public profile for fans, parents, and recruiters to see.
