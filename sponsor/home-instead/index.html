<p>Paul and Lori Hogan founded Home Instead, Inc. in 1994 right here in Omaha, Nebraska. Paul's own family experience caring for his grandmother led him to realize many families could use the help of an in-home caregiver. He and Lori set about creating a company to help seniors to live independently at home. That mission still drives the company and its franchise network today.</p>

<p>Omaha's Home Instead, Inc. began franchising in 1995. Today, the Home Instead Senior Care network has grown to include more than 1,000 franchises around the world -- including this office in Omaha, NE. While our franchise network is international, our office is local. And to us, senior home care is personal.</p>
