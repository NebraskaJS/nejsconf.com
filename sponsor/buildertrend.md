> BuilderTREND was founded in 2006 as a result of a simple observation: Residential construction companies needed a user-friendly, web-based software. Software to help them build more projects, build them faster, reduce costly communication errors, and ultimately maximize customer satisfaction. Homebuilders and remodelers can use our technology for lead management, bid solicitation and management, scheduling, and warrant administration. While the system has expanded and become the most widely used and comprehensive cloud system in residential construction, our core principals about customer service have not changed. At the end of the day, we are a customer service company, we just happen to have the best residential construction software in the world.
