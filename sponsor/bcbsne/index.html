<p>1939 was the beginning of a long tradition of health care coverage in Nebraska. A group of medical professionals, business leaders and others came together to create an organization that today serves over 700,000 people.</p>

<p>To millions of Americans, Blue Cross and Blue Shield represents peace of mind when it's needed the most. That's because the Blue Cross and Blue Shield brand represents the nation's largest and most experienced health care benefit companies.</p>

<p>The Blue Cross and Blue Shield organization is not one single company, but rather a confederation of independent, community-based Plans. Collectively, Blue Cross and Blue Shield Plans cover more than 98 million people - nearly one-third of all Americans - in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. With the power of Blue, we are able to provide broad network access and competitive discounts to our clients.</p>

<p>We are a Nebraska-based company, well-versed in the intricacies of employee health benefits. Our Customer Focus philosophy continues to provide our members with world-class customer service and quality programs.</p>
