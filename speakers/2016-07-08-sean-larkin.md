<h2>Webpack: The Core&nbsp;Concepts</h2>

<p>Webpack is JavaScript module bundler that has taken the world by storm, but a lack of great docs and wealth of boilerplates have led to many people using it, but not understand it!</p>

<p>I'm going to break down the 4 concepts everyone should know when using webpack so they can take and make it their own.</p>

<p>My hope for you is that by the time we’re done, you’ll set fire to every Gulpfile and Gruntfile you’ve ever written, destroy all those extra style and script tags in your browser, and possess the tools needed to make the best modern web apps, without sacrificing developer experience. Join me while we webpack ALL the things.</p>
