<p>Nobody knows bad code like Justin Searls. Relative to his peers, he is able to produce bad code effortlessly. He spends so much time with bad code, that he's got a lot of experience thinking and talking about some of the reasons the industry has gotten so good at producing bad software. In 2011, Justin and Todd Kaufman founded <a href="http://testdouble.com">Test Double</a>, an agency dedicated to identifying what's broken about software and what we can collectively do to fix it.</p>
