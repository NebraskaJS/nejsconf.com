<h2>Communication Is Just As Important As&nbsp;Code</h2>

<p>Andrea has taught communication skills to thousands of people in world-class brands across the globe, including The Smithsonian, The Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Verizon, and more. If you’re looking to take your career to the next level, this is one talk you won’t want to miss.</p>
