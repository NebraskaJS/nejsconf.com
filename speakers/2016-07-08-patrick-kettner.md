<p>Patrick Kettner won an eighth grade talent show competition singing Gloria Gaynor’s 1978 disco hit “I Will Survive”, and things have been looking up ever since. He has traded in the golden microphone for a PM position on Microsoft Edge, as well as being the lead developer for Modernizr. He lives in Seattle with his wonderful partner Katrina, son Holden, and dog Baxter.</p>

<h2>Modern Websites for the Modern&nbsp;Web</h2>

<p>It seems like new APIs for the web are released every week. It would be cool to be able to use them, but if you need to make websites for the average user, you won’t be able to use them for years - right? Wrong. I will go over how creating feature rich and super fast front end applications, integrating over a dozen cutting edge web features, all while supporting even the oldest of web clients. If you want to see a 100% client side offline enabled application work in every browser to Mosiac, and even be ported to a command line GUI (yes GUI), come check it out!</p>
