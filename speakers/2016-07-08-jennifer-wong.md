<h2>I Think I Know What You’re Talking About, But I’m Not&nbsp;Sure</h2>

<p>Recursion, instantiate, lexical scope - where do these words come from?! If you’ve ever been in conversation with other developers and thought, “I think I know what they’re talking about, but I’m not sure…”, you’re not alone.
