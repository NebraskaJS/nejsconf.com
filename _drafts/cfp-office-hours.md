We know [submitting a conference talk proposal][cfp] can be intimidating, whether you're an experienced speaker or it's your first time submitting a talk (especially the latter).

And for NEJS CONF to be a success, it's important that we get great *talks*, not just folks who already know howto naturally fill out a CFP.

To that end, we're hosting **CFP Office Hours** - scheduled sessions where you can chat with conference organizers [@mattdsteele][@mattdsteele] and [@your\_name\_here][@talk2] about anything related to NEJS CONF's CFP.

Perhaps you have questions about the conference, want feedback on a proposal you've written, or just need someone to help convince you to actually submit your idea for a tlak, we're here for you.

[Join us on Google Hangouts on **Sunday, June 19 from 6:00 - 7:00pm CST**][hangout]

Of course, you can always send us questions [through Twitter][twitter] (our DMs are open), or via [e-mail][email].

We'd love to see your proposal be a success. Remember, the CFP for NEJS CONF closes on June 25!
