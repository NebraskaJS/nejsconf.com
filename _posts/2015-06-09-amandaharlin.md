## Architecting Communities

As software creators, we work hard at our craft. Every day we use the latest techniques to ensure we are always delivering the highest quality code and managing our time and processes efficiently. Continuous Integration, Issue trackers, Kanban Boards, Cloud services, Version Control and Automation are regular tools of the trade.

Why can't we use these tools to also effectively build our Developer Communities? 

In this talk, I will highlight some of the ways Techlahoma has brought together technologies from various languages and disciplines to manage and foster community growth in central Oklahoma. Everything you need to build your community is at your fingertips.
