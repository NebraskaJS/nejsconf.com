Want to keep the fun going after the conference ends?
We have a few events scheduled for Saturday morning that should be a blast!

These optional events are a great way to connect with folks you meet at NEJS CONF.

## Downtown B-Cycle Bicycle Tour - 8:30am

Come check out Downtown Omaha through a guided tour on [Heartland B-Cycle](https://heartland.bcycle.com/), Omaha's bike-sharing system!

We'll be pedaling out at 8:30, and get you back in time for brunch!

This event is free, but space is limited.

## Omaha Coding Women Brunch - 10am

[Omaha Coding Women][ocw] is excited to be hosting a post NEJS Conf brunch! We will be meeting in the upstairs area at [Wilson and Washburn][ww].
Bring your laptops. We intend to have a casual atmosphere to chat about cool topics that came up during the conference and also pair up on or show off projects that you all have been working on.

This event is open to all. If you aren't able to make the conference, you're still invited. The fun starts at 10am and will continue until noon.
