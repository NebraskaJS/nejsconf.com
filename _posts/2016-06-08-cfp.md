The NebraskaJS Conference is continuing into its second year. We sold out last year’s event at capacity with 200 people. The conference was born out of the NebraskaJS User Group which spans two cities and boasts over 1000 members. We’ve held over 50 free meetups in six years!

*Compensation*: We will compensate all speakers for travel and lodging costs. We think it’s crazy that some conferences don’t cover these basics for speakers.

*Diversity and Code of Conduct*: Our conference is dedicated to representing a variety of diverse perspectives on stage and in the audience. We are committed to supporting an inclusive environment regardless of age, gender, gender-expression, sexuality, race, financial background, physical and mental abilities. To that end, all NEJS CONF event participants (including speakers, organizers, and sponsors) must agree to respect and abide by our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/). We’re committed to making a safe space for all attendees to make friends, learn, and have fun.

If you’re interested in participating, please [add a proposal on papercall.io](https://www.papercall.io/nejsconf) before the June 25th deadline. We look forward to seeing your proposals!
