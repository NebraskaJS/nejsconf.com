NEJS CONF continues after [Andrea's keynote][andrea], with a party just upstairs! Here's some details you might want to know:

## Food and Drinks!

We'll provide dinner, with vegan and gluten-free options.
We'll also have a stocked bar, and you'll get a drink coupon if you wish to partake. 

## Old Fashioned Soda Fountain!

Ever had a phosphate? Neither had we, until we checked out the [Durham's soda fountain][soda]. We'll have it up & running for your enjoyment (you'll get a drink coupon for the soda fountain as well).

Make yourself an old-timey drink and maybe talk about an old-timey JavaScript framework (say, React 0.x)

## Board Games!

After dinner, we'll have a library of board games available to play during the after-party.
New to modern board games like Ticket To Ride?
No worries, we'll also have a few Games Ambassadors around to help get you started!

## Board Games Giveaway!

We're partnering with [Spielbound][spielbound] to raffle off a dozen board games at the end of the evening.
You can walk away from NEJS CONF with the game you just played!

Make sure you keep your conference badge with you, as you'll need it to check in.

+1s are also welcome to attend.

See you at the after-party!
