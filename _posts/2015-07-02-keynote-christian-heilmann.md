Christian is one of the titans of Open Web advocacy. His storied past includes developer evangelist roles with *Yahoo* and *Mozilla*.

His current gig is for *Microsoft* which he describes as “Bringing the open web to Microsoft and vice versa.” His move to Microsoft is really a testament to their new attitude towards web standards compliance and working with the developer community.

He’s a prolific blogger at his own web site [ChristianHeilmann.com](http://christianheilmann.com/), evidenced by archives that date back to 2005! Also a prolific speaker, his [Lanyrd profile](http://lanyrd.com/profile/codepo8/) boasts a speaking repertoire of 120 events in 26 different countries.

He’s written two books: [Beginning JavaScript](http://beginningjavascript.com/) and [Web Development Solutions: Ajax, APIs, Libraries, and Hosted Services Made Easy](http://www.amazon.com/Web-Development-Solutions-Libraries-Services/dp/1590598067/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1239691912&sr=8-6). He’s also contributed to chapters in [The Art & Science of JavaScript](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0980285844/onlinetoolsorg) and [Web Accessibility: Web Standards and Regulatory Compliance](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596382/onlinetoolsorg).
