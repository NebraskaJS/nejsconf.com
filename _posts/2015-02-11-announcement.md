NebraskaJS is throwing a JavaScript conference!

The NebraskaJS Conference is a first-time conference but is born out of a long-standing vibrant NebraskaJS User Group that spans two cities and boasts almost 700 members. This isn’t our first rodeo—we’ve held over 45 attend-for-free meetups in five years.

## Highlights

* Single Day, Single Track Conference
* Friday, August 7th, 2015
* Held at Omaha’s world famous Henry Doorly Zoo and Aquarium, named [#1 Zoo in the World by TripAdvisor](http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/05/travel/tripadvisor-best-zoos/index.html)
