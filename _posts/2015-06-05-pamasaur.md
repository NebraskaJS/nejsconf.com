## Believe in Streams

There’s a data structure that essentially makes you a *wizard* and that data structure is streams. In this talk, you’ll learn more about the best data structure you didn’t know enough about and how to leverage its power in JavaScript. Expect to learn about IO streams, generators, and the latest developments in the awesome awesomeness that is streams.

* Streams? (what are they)
* Streams!!!!! (why they are f*ing amazing)
* Streams in practice (ex. proxy servers)
* Streams in JavaScript (Node, generators in ES6, upcoming browser standards, reactive streams)
